- Rulings: db.ygoresources.com, Rulebook PDFs, Reddit
- Bot Framework: Python
- UI: Streamlit or Gradio
- Hosting: Hugging Face Spaces, Discord bot (optional)
- Storage: JSON / SQLite, FAISS/Chroma for vector search

Development Roadmap:
--------------------
Phase 1 – MVP (Local Script)
- [ ] Fetch card data using YGOProDeck API
- [ ] Scrape + store ruling data from db.ygoresources.com
- [ ] Parse official rulebook into searchable sections
- [ ] Build function: input question → return matching ruling
- [ ] Use OpenAI API to rephrase and explain rulings
- [ ] Output answer + source + confidence

Phase 2 – Web UI or CLI
- [ ] Build chatbot interface with Streamlit or Gradio
- [ ] Accept text question, run retrieval + LLM
- [ ] Display ruling response + confidence + citation

Phase 3 – Community Validation
- [ ] Invite judges to test the bot with known questions
- [ ] Collect feedback on accuracy and clarity

Phase 4 – Discord Bot or Hosted App
- [ ] Deploy as a Discord bot or to Hugging Face
- [ ] Explore monetization via freemium features

Data Sources:
-------------
- YGOProDeck API – Official card text
- db.ygoresources.com – Card-specific rulings
- Official Rulebook PDF – Core rule structure
- Reddit/Facebook – Real ruling scenarios and clarifications
- Judge documents – Complex mechanics and PSCT logic

Prompt Strategy:
----------------
"You are a Yu-Gi-Oh! ruling assistant. Your job is to explain card interactions based only
on the information provided. If the ruling is unclear or missing, say 'Please consult a judge.'
Always cite your sources. Do not make assumptions."

Safety Measures:
----------------
- [ ] Fallback response when data is unclear or missing
- [ ] Flag questions needing judge verification
- [ ] Color-code responses by confidence level (Official, Community, Inferred)

Long-Term Features:
-------------------
- Combo legality simulator
- Deck legality checker
- Tournament-prep flashcard mode
- Ruling history archive by card

Monetization Ideas:
-------------------
- Free access with optional Patreon/Ko-fi
- Premium Discord commands or combo tools
- Offline or downloadable judge companion app
- Sponsorships or streamer integration

Final Note:
-----------
This is a community-first, rule-accurate, beginner-friendly tool designed to enhance understanding
and fair play in Yu-Gi-Oh! — built for the love of the game.
