# ABOUT THE GAME

## CREATE YOUR OWN DECK

With thousands of cards to choose from, you can create and
customise your own Deck with your favourite cards. Every Duellist
will have their own unique Deck, completely different from every
other Duellists Deck, which makes it really exciting to play!

## BATTLE WITH FANTASTIC MONSTERS & GREAT COMBOS

Even if a card does not have enough power on its own,
it may become powerful when combined
with other cards. It is fun to collect all the
different cards available and create your
own combos, then unleash them in a Duel.

## POWER UP YOUR DECK WITH BOOSTER PACKS

Booster Packs are released every few months,
bringing new cards and new combos to add new
strength to your Deck. Duels evolve every time
a new Booster Pack is released, keeping your
Duels cool and exciting.

# GETTING STARTED

## Things you need to Duel

### Deck (40 to 60 cards)

Assemble your favorite cards into a Deck that follows these rules:
* The Deck must be 40 to 60 cards.
* You can only have up to 3 copies of the same card in your Deck,
Extra Deck and Side Deck combined.

Also, some cards are Forbidden, Limited or Semi-Limited in official
tournaments.

Try to keep your Deck close to the 40-card minimum. Having a Deck
with too many cards makes it hard to draw your best cards when you
need them. This Deck is called your Main Deck.

### Extra Deck (0 to 15 cards)

This Deck consists of Xyz Monsters, Synchro Monsters and Fusion
Monsters, which can be used during the game if you meet certain
requirements. The rules for Extra Decks are:
* You can have up to 15 cards in the Extra Deck.
* The Extra Deck can contain Xyz Monsters, Synchro Monsters and
Fusion Monsters, in any combination.
* These cards are not counted towards the 40-card minimum limit
of your Main Deck.

### Side Deck (0 to 15 cards)

This is a separate Deck of cards you can use to change your Deck during
a Match. After each Duel in a Match, you can swap any card from
your Side Deck with a card from your side Deck and/or Extra Deck to
customise your strategy against your opponent. The number of cards in
your Side Decks must not exceed 15. The number of cards in your Side
Deck before and after you swap any cards must be exactly the same.

### Additional items you may need

* Coin: Some cards require a coin toss. If you play with these,
have a coin ready to flip.
* Dice: Just like the coin, there are some cards that need a die roll.
If you play with these, have a standard die ready with numbers 1 through 6.
* Counters: Some cards will require markers (called counters) to keep
track of things like the number of turns, or a card’s power level.
You can use small objects like glass beads, paper clips, or pennies
for the counters, which are then placed on these face-up cards.
* Monster Tokens: Tokens are used to represent monsters that can be
created by card effects. Any object used for a Token needs to have
two distinct ways to place it that can clearly indicate the monster’s
battle position.

### Items which can help during a Duel

* Calculator: LP changes quickly during a Duel. It’s smart to use a
calculator to keep track of your LP. During important Duels, 
you should track your LP on paper as well to be extra-careful.
* Card Sleeves: Plastic sleeves can prevent your cards from getting bent
or scratched. If you use card sleeves, they all have to be the same so your cards aren’t marked.

# THE GAME MAT

The Game Mat helps you organise your cards
during a Duel. When you use your cards you place
them on the Game Mat. Different kinds of cards
are placed in different Zones.

Each Duellist needs their own Game Mat; place
them together while Dueling. This combined space
is known as “the ﬁeld.” The Game Mat contained
in this product is just for your half of the ﬁeld.
The cards you “control” are the cards on your side
of the ﬁeld.

You can also Duel without using the Game Mat as
long as you remember where to place the cards.

## Main Monster Zone

This is where you put your monsters when they’re played.
You can have up to 5 cards here. There are 3 ways to
position your Monster Cards: face-up Attack Position,
face-up Defense Position, and face-down Defense Position.
Place the card upright for Attack Position, and sideways
for Defense Position.

## Spell & Trap Zone / Pendulum Zone

This is where you put Spell & Trap Cards. You can have up to
5 cards here. You place them here face-up to activate them,
or place them face-down. Pendulum Monster Cards can be
activated in the leftmost and rightmost zones as Spells. This
causes the zone you use to also become a Pendulum Zone
for as long as the Pendulum Monster Card is there. (See
page 23 for details on Pendulum Monster Cards.)

## Graveyard (GY)

When Monster Cards are destroyed, and when Spell &
Trap Cards are used, they’re sent face-up to this space.
The contents of both players’ Graveyards are public
knowledge, and your opponent can look through yours at
any time during the Duel. The order of the cards in the
Graveyard should not be changed. Graveyard is shortened
in the card text to “GY”.

## Deck

Your Deck is placed face-down in this space. You draw cards
from here to add to your hand. If a card effect requires you
to reveal cards from your Deck, or look through it, shuffle
it and put it back in this space afterwards.

## Field Zone

Special Spell Cards called Field Spell Cards are played here.
Each player can have 1 Field Spell Card on their own side
of the ﬁeld. To use another Field Spell, send your previous
one to the Graveyard. Field Spell Cards do not count
towards the 5-card limit of your Spell & Trap Zone.

## Extra Deck

Place your Extra Deck face-down in this space. You can
look at the cards in your own Extra Deck during the game.
During a Duel, Extra Deck Monsters may be Summoned
to the ﬁeld from here using special methods. Pendulum
Monster Cards that would be sent from the ﬁeld to the
Graveyard are placed face-up here.

## Extra Monster Zone

This is where you put your monsters that are Summoned to
the ﬁeld by special methods from the Extra Deck, like Link
Monsters and Fusion Monsters. Normally, each player can
only use 1 of these zones. A monster placed in this zone
does not count towards the 5-monster limit of your Main
Monster Zone.

# Game Cards

## Monster Cards

### HOW TO READ A CARD

* Card Name: This is the card’s name. When a card name is mentioned in card
text it appears in quotations. If cards have the same name, they are
considered to be the same card.
* Level: Count the number of stars under the card's name to ﬁnd out the monster’s Level.
For Xyz Monsters, the number of stars is the Rank of the monster, and is on left.
* Attribute: Every monster has an Attribute. This Attribute is sometimes
important for card effects.
* Type: Monsters are divided into various Types. Some monsters with
specific abilities will have additional information here at the top of the Card Description, next to their Type.
* Card Number: A card’s identification number is found under the card's art and above the Card Description.
This number is useful for collecting, and for sorting your collection.
* ATK (Attack Points) / DEF (Defense Position): ATK is a monster’s Attack Points and DEF is a monster’s Defense
Points. High Attack and Defense Points are good when battling!
* Card Description: Card effects are written here, describing the monster’s special
abilities and how to use them. Normally, the effects of monsters
cannot be used while they are Set face-down on the ﬁeld. Yellow
Normal Monster Cards do not have effects, and have a description
of them written here that does not affect the game.

### WHAT IS A MONSTER CARD?

Monster Cards are used to battle and defeat your opponent. Battles
between Monster Cards are the foundation of any Duel.

There are many kinds of Monster Cards. This game is more than a
simple slug fest, so monsters with high Attack and Defense Points will
not be enough. There are also monsters with strong special effects
even though their ATK and DEF points are low. Therefore, your
success in a Duel depends on how skilfully you can make use of the
different kinds of cards. Let’s take a look at the different kinds of
monsters.

* Normal Monster: These are basic Monster Cards without special abilities. Many
Normal Monsters have higher Attack Points and Defense Points than Effect Monsters,
instead of having special abilities.
* Effect Monsters: An Effect Monster is a monster that has special abilities.
The effects of these monsters are split into four categories.
    * Continuous Effect
    * Ignition Effect
    * Quick Effect
    * Trigger Effect (including Flip)

#### Continuous Effect

This effect is active while the Effect Monster Card is face-up on
the ﬁeld. The effect starts when the face-up monster appears
on the ﬁeld, and ends once that monster is gone or is no longer
face-up; there is no trigger for its activation. These monsters
are most useful if you have a strategy to protect them while
they are on the ﬁeld.

Example: Monsters with 2000 or less ATK cannot declare an attack.

#### Ignition Effect

You use this type of effect just by declaring its activation during
your Main Phase. There are some Ignition Effects that have a cost to activate,
like discarding cards from your hand, Tributing a monster, or paying LP.
Because you can choose when to activate this type of effect, it’s easy to
create combos with them.

Example: You can Tribute this card, then target 1 monster
on the ﬁeld; destroy that target.

#### Quick Effect

These are special monster effects that you can activate even
during your opponent’s turn. These types of effects have a
Spell Speed of 2, even though all other monster effects have a
Spell Speed of 1. Since it’s difficult for your opponent to predict
these cards, they can give them an unexpected surprise.

(Formerly called Multi-Trigger Effects.)

#### Trigger Effect

These effects are activated at specific times, such as “during
the Standby Phase” or “when this monster is destroyed”. These
cards can make for some great combos, but it’s easier for your
opponent to predict what will happen, so they might try to stop you.

Example: When this card is destroyed by battle and sent to the
Graveyard: Target 1 card on the ﬁeld; destroy that target.

#### Flip Effect

Flip effect is a part of the Trigger Effect.

This is an effect that is activated when a face-down card is
ﬂipped face-up. This can happen when it is Flip Summoned,
attacked while face-down, or ﬂipped face-up by a card effect.
These effects start with the word “FLIP:” on the card. When
you have a face-down monster, your opponent must be wary
because they don’t know if it has a Flip effect or not.

Example: FLIP: Draw 1 card.

### LINK MONSTERS

A Link Monster is a new kind of monster with the ability to increase
the number of monsters you can Summon from your Extra Deck.
In addition to the 1 Extra Monster Zone you can usually use, you can
also Summon monsters from the Extra Deck to any of your Main
Monster Zones that has a Link Monster’s red arrow pointing to it.

Link Arrows - A Link Monster can apply its effects on cards or zones that its lit-up,
red Link Arrows point to. When a Link Monster’s red arrow points to a monster,
those monsters are “linked”. When two Link Monsters have red arrows that point
at each other, they are “co-linked”.

Link Materials - These are the Link Materials you need to Summon this
Monster. Use this “recipe” printed under the card's Type to Link Summon the monster.

LINK Rating - This is the number of Link Arrows that monster has and the
number of monsters needed to Summon it.

#### HOW TO LINK SUMMON

1. Check the material of the Link Monster you want to Summon.
2. During your Main Phase, declare that you are Link Summoning,
send a number of face-up monsters from your ﬁeld to the
Graveyard equal to the Link Rating of that Link Monster. They
must also match the material requirements listed in the monster’s
“recipe” written on the card.
3. Place the Link Monster from your Extra Deck in the Extra Monster
Zone, or one of your Main Monster Zones that another Link
Monster is pointing to.

If 2 Extra Monster Zones are available, you can choose either one to
Summon your monster. If there is a Link Monster already on the ﬁeld,
you can Link Summon a monster in one of your zones it points to.
