What is the Yu-Gi-Oh! TRADING CARD GAME?
With the Yu-Gi-Oh! TRADING CARD GAME you can take part in the 
exciting card game action seen in the family of Yu-Gi-Oh! TV and 
comic mega-hits.
In this game, two players Duel each other using a variety of Monster, 
Spell, and Trap Cards to defeat their opponent’s monsters and be the 
first to drop the other’s LP (Life Points) to 0.
Everything you need to start playing is in this Deck, but there are 
thousands more cards to choose from, so collecting additional cards 
in Booster Packs will let you customize your Deck and increase your 
chances of winning!
This is the official Yu-Gi-Oh! TRADING CARD GAME rulebook. It is 
important to learn how to play correctly, so you should read this 
rulebook before playing if you are new to the game. Understanding 
the rules will help you make the best use of your cards, so keep 
the rulebook handy during your first few games. You can also visit  
www.yugioh-card.com for more information.

ABOUT THE GAME
CREATE YOUR OWN DECK
With thousands of cards to choose from, you can create and 
customize your own Deck with your favorite cards. Every Duelist 
will have their own unique Deck, completely different from every 
other Duelist’s Deck, which makes it really exciting to play!
BATTLE WITH FANTASTIC MONSTERS & GREAT COMBOS
Even if a card does not have enough power on its own, 
it may become powerful when combined 
with other cards. It is fun to collect all the 
different cards available and create your 
own combos, then unleash them in a Duel.
POWER UP YOUR DECK WITH BOOSTER PACKS
Booster Packs are released every few months, 
bringing new cards and new combos to add new 
strength to your Deck. Duels evolve every time 
a new Booster Pack is released, keeping your 
Duels cool and exciting.

Getting Started

Getting Started
Assemble your favorite cards into a Deck that follows these rules: 
lThe Deck must be 40 to 60 cards.
lYou can only have up to 3 copies of the same card in your Deck, 
    Extra Deck and Side Deck combined.
Also, some cards are Forbidden, Limited or Semi-Limited in official 
tournaments. (See page 45 for details.)
Try to keep your Deck close to the 40-card minimum. Having a Deck 
with too many cards makes it hard to draw your best cards when you 
need them. This Deck is called your Main Deck.
This Deck consists of Xyz Monsters, Synchro Monsters and Fusion 
Monsters, which can be used during the game if you meet certain 
requirements. The rules for Extra Decks are: 
lYou can have up to 15 cards in the Extra Deck.
lThe Extra Deck can contain Xyz Monsters, Synchro Monsters and 
    Fusion Monsters, in any combination.
lThese cards are not counted towards the 40-card minimum limit \ 
    of your Main Deck.
This is a separate Deck of cards you can use to change your Deck during 
a Match. After each Duel in a Match, you can swap any card from 
your Side Deck with a card from your side Deck and/or Extra Deck to 
customize your strategy against your opponent. The number of cards in 
your Side Decks must not exceed 15. The number of cards in your Side 
Deck before and after you swap any cards must be exactly the same. 
Side Deck ...........................................(0 to 15 cards)

Getting Started
Some cards require a coin toss. If you 
play with these, have a coin ready to 
flip.
Just like the coin, there are some 
cards that need a die roll. If you play 
with these, have a standard die ready 
with numbers 1 through 6.
Some cards will require markers 
(called counters) to keep track of 
things like the number of turns, or a 
card’s power level. You can use small 
objects like glass beads, paper clips, 
or pennies for the counters, which are 
then placed on these face-up cards.
Tokens 
are 
used 
to 
represent 
monsters that can be created by card 
effects. Any object used for a Token 
needs to have two distinct ways to 
place it that can clearly indicate the 
monster’s battle position. (See page 
45 for details.)
LP changes quickly during a Duel. It is 
smart to use a calculator to keep track 
of your LP. During important Duels, 
you should track your LP on paper as 
well to be extra-careful.
Plastic sleeves can prevent your 
cards from getting bent or scratched. 
If you use card sleeves, they all have 
to be the same so your cards are not 
marked.

The Game Mat
Monster
Zone
Spell & Trap
Zone
Graveyard
The Game Mat helps you organize your cards 
during a Duel. When you use your cards you 
place them on the Game Mat. Different kinds of 
cards are placed in different Zones.
Each Duelist needs their own Game Mat; place 
them together while Dueling. This combined 
space is known as “the field.” The Game Mat 
contained in this product is just for your half of 
the field. The cards you “control” are the cards 
on your side of the field.
You can also Duel without using the Game Mat as 
long as you remember where to place the cards.
This is where you put your monsters when they are played. You 
can have up to 5 cards here. There are 3 main ways to position your 
Monster Cards: face-up Attack Position, face-up Defense Position, 
and face-down Defense Position. Place the card vertically for 
Attack Position, and horizontally for Defense Position.
This is where you put Spell and Trap Cards. You can have up to 
5 cards here. You place them here face-up to activate them, or 
place them face-down. Because a Spell Card is placed in this 
zone when it is activated, no further Spell Cards can be used if all 
5 spaces are occupied already.
When Monster Cards are destroyed, and when Spell & Trap Cards 
are used, they are sent face-up to this space. The contents of both 
players’ Graveyards are public knowledge, and your opponent 
can look through yours at any time during the Duel. The order of 
the cards in the Graveyard should not be changed.

Your Deck is placed face-down in this space. Players draw cards 
from here to their hands. If a card effect requires you to reveal 
cards from your Deck, or look through it, shuffle it and put it back 
in this space after resolving the effect.
Special Spell Cards called Field Spell Cards are played here. Each 
player can have 1 Field Spell Card on their own side of the field. To 
use another Field Spell, send your previous one to the Graveyard. 
Field Spell Cards do not count towards the 5-card limit of your 
Spell & Trap Zone.
Place your Extra Deck face-down in this space. You can look at 
the cards in your own Extra Deck during the game. This area was 
formerly for the Fusion Deck. Any card effects applied to the 
Fusion Deck are now applied to the Extra Deck.
Field Zone
When you activate a Pendulum Monster Card as a Spell Card, you 
place it face-up in this space. Pendulum Monster Cards played as 
Spell Cards do not count towards the 5-card limit of your Spell & 
Trap Zone or Monster Zone. (See page 12 for details on Pendulum 
Monster Cards.)

Card Description
Every monster has an Attribute. 
This Attribute is sometimes 
important for card effects.
Monsters are divided into various Types. Some monsters with 
specific abilities will have additional information here too, next to 
their Type.
A card’s identification number is found here. This number is useful 
for collecting, and for sorting your collection. 
ATK is a monster’s Attack Points and DEF is a monster’s Defense 
Points. High Attack and Defense Points are good when battling! 
Card effects are written here, describing the monster’s special 
abilities and how to use them. Normally, the effects of monsters 
cannot be used while they are Set face-down on the field. Yellow 
Normal Monster Cards do not have effects, and have a description 
of them written here that does not affect the game.

WHAT IS A MONSTER CARD?
Monster Cards are used to battle and defeat your opponent. Battles 
between Monster Cards are the foundation of any Duel.
There are many kinds of Monster Cards. This game is more than a 
simple slugfest, so monsters with high Attack and Defense Points will 
not be enough. There are also monsters with strong special effects 
even though their ATK and DEF points are low. Therefore, your 
success in a Duel depends on how skillfully you can make use of the 
different kinds of cards. Let us take a look at the different kinds of 
monsters.
These are basic Monster Cards 
without special abilities. Many 
Normal Monsters have higher 
Attack Points and Defense 
Points than Effect Monsters, 
instead of having special 
abilities.

<<< Effect Monsters
An Effect Monster is a monster 
that has special abilities.
The effects of these monsters 
are split into four categories:
• Continuous Effect 
• Ignition Effect
• Quick Effect
• Trigger Effect (including Flip)
Continuous Effect 
This effect is active while the Effect Monster Card is face-up on 
the field. The effect starts when the face-up monster appears 
on the field, and ends once that monster is gone or is no longer 
face-up; there is no trigger for its activation. These monsters 
are most useful if you have a strategy to protect them while 
they are on the field.
Monsters with 2000 or less ATK cannot declare 
an attack.
Example
9
Game Cards
Ignition Effect
You use this type of effect just by declaring its activation during 
your Main Phase. (See Turn Structure, page 30.) There are some 
Ignition Effects that have a cost to activate, like discarding cards 
from your hand, Tributing a monster, or paying LP. Because you 
can choose when to activate this type of effect, it is easy to 
create combos with them.
You can Tribute this card, then target 1 monster 
on the field; destroy that target.
Example
Quick Effect 
These are special monster effects that you can activate even 
during your opponent’s turn. These types of effects have a Spell 
Speed of 2, even though all other monster effects have a Spell 
Speed of 1. (See Spell Speed, page 41.) Since it is difficult for 
your opponent to predict these cards, they can give them an 
unexpected surprise.
(Formerly called Multi-Trigger Effects.)
During either player’s turn, when an effect is activated:
You can target 1 card in your Graveyard; Special Summon it.
Example
10
Game Cards
Trigger Effect
These effects are activated at specific times, such as “during 
the Standby Phase” or “when this monster is destroyed”. These 
cards can make for some great combos, but it is easier for your 
opponent to predict what will happen, so they might try to stop 
you.
When this card is destroyed by battle and sent to the 
Graveyard: Target 1 card on the field; destroy that target.
Example
Flip Effect 
Flip effect is a part of the Trigger Effect.
This is an effect that is activated when a face-down card is 
flipped face-up. This can happen when it is Flip Summoned, 
attacked while face-down, or flipped face-up by a card effect. 
These effects start with the word “FLIP:” on the card. When 
you have a face-down monster, your opponent must be wary 
because they do not know if it has a Flip effect or not. 
FLIP: Draw 1 card.

<<< Pendulum Monster Cards
Pendulum Monster Cards are 
a new kind of card that blurs 
the line between Monsters 
and Spells! They can be

in your Pendulum Zones to 
activate extra special abilities 
and allow you to Pendulum 
Summon!
Pendulum Effect - When you play this card 
as a Spell Card in your Pendulum Zone, this is 
its effect. Some Pendulum Monster Cards may 
not have Pendulum Effects.
Monster Effect - When you play this card 
as a regular Monster Card, this is its effect. 
Some Pendulum Monster Cards may not have 
monster effects.

Pendulum Summoning.
Check the Pendulum Scales on the sides of your 2 Pendulum 
Monster Cards, then Special Summon as many monsters as 
you want from your hand and Extra Deck whose Levels are in 
between those Pendulum Scales.
Whenever one of your Pendulum Monster Cards on the field (regardless 
of which Zone it is in, or even if it is a monster or not) would be sent 
to the Graveyard, place it face-up on your Extra Deck instead. You can 
Pendulum Summon it back to the field later!

Choose an Xyz Monster from your Extra Deck that you 
have the right Xyz Materials for. The Xyz Materials 
should be face-up on your side of the field.
Stack the Xyz Materials on top of each other.
Take the Xyz Monster from your Extra Deck and put it

Send the Fusion Materials to the Graveyard, then take 
the appropriate Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck 
and play it onto the field in either face-up Attack or 
Defense Position. Finally, place your Summoning card 
in the Graveyard. (If another card effect causes your 
Fusion Materials to be sent to a place other than the 
Graveyard when your Summoning card resolves, send 
them to that other place, but the Fusion Summon still 
happens anyway.)
Remember that in order to use a Fusion Monster during a Duel it needs to be in 
your Extra Deck. Since Fusion Summons require specific cards, be sure and include 
those necessary cards in your Main Deck!

How to Ritual Summon
Ritual 
Monsters 
are 
special 
monsters 
that 
are 
Special 
Summoned with a specific Ritual 
Spell Card, along with a required 
Tribute. Ritual Monster Cards 
are placed in the Main Deck and 
cannot be Summoned unless you 
have all the proper cards together 
in your hand or on the field. Ritual 
Monsters generally have high ATK 
and DEF and some have special 
abilities, just like Fusion Monsters.
When you have a Ritual Spell Card, along with the matching Ritual Monster 
Card, in your hand, along with the required Tribute (as listed on the Ritual 
Spell Card), you can activate the Ritual Spell Card, placing it in the Spell & 
Trap Zone.
If the activation of the Ritual Spell Card is successful, 
Tribute monsters by sending them from your hand or the 
field to the Graveyard. The Ritual Spell Card will list the 
required amount to Tribute.
After sending the Tributed monsters to the Graveyard, play 
the Ritual Monster Card onto the field in either face-up 
Attack or Defense Position. Finally, place the Ritual Spell 
Card in the Graveyard.

Game Cards
There are several ways to play monsters onto the field. These ways 
can be categorized into 2 groups: actions that can be done only once 
per turn, and actions that can be done multiple times per turn. 
This is the most common way to Summon a monster. Simply 
play a Monster Card from your hand onto the field in face-up 
Attack Position. All Normal Monsters, and most Effect Monsters 
(unless they have a specific restriction), can be Summoned in 
this way.
However, for monsters that are Level 5 or higher, you must 
Tribute at least 1 monster you control before the Normal 
Summon. This is called a Tribute Summon. Monsters that are 
Level 5 or 6 require 1 Tribute and Monsters that are Level 7 or 
higher require 2 Tributes.
To play a Monster Card from your hand in face-down Defense Position 
is called a Set. In order to Set monsters that are Level 5 or higher, you 
still need to Tribute. 
It is important to remember that a monster Set on the field in face-down 
Defense Position IS NOT considered Summoned. It has been Set and can 
be Summoned with a Flip Summon or flipped face-up by an attack or card 
effect. Remember, you can only Normal Summon OR Set once per turn, 
so if you Set a monster you cannot Normal Summon a monster that turn.
Note: You cannot play a monster from your hand onto the field in 
face-up Defense Position.

You can do as many of these during a turn as you want
You can change a face-down Defense Position monster into 
face-up Attack Position, without using a card effect. This is 
called a Flip Summon. When you Flip Summon, you cannot 
change the monster to face-up Defense Position, only to 
face-up Attack Position. A Monster Card cannot be Flip 
Summoned in the same turn that it was Set onto the field. You 
cannot use most monsters’ effects until they are face-up.
Some monsters can be played onto the field without being 
Normal Summoned or Set. This is called a Special Summon. 
Pendulum Summons, Xyz Summons, Synchro Summons, Fusion 
Summons and Ritual Summons are all Special Summons. Some 
Effect Monsters also have specific conditions that allow you to 
Special Summon them. Unless otherwise specified, a Special 
Summoned monster is played onto the field in your choice of 
face-up Attack Position or face-up Defense Position.
Monsters can also be Special Summoned onto the field through 
the effect of another card. This is different from “Special 
Summon Monsters.” You cannot use a card effect to Special 
Summon those monsters from your hand, Deck, or the Graveyard 
unless it was properly Special Summoned first. For example, if a 
Synchro Monster is sent from your Extra Deck to the Graveyard 
without being Synchro Summoned, you cannot use a Spell Card 
to Special Summon it from the Graveyard, because Synchro 
Monsters have to be properly Special Summoned first, before 
they can be Special Summoned by another card’s effect.

Normal Spell Cards
Ritual Spell Cards
Spell Cards can normally be 
activated only during your Main 
Phase, and help you out with 
different effects. Spell Cards 
have many powerful effects, 
like destroying other cards or 
strengthening monsters. Save 
these cards in your hand until 
you can get the best results out 
of them.
Normal Spell Cards have single-use effects. To use a Normal Spell Card, 
announce its activation to your opponent, placing it face-up on the field. 
If the activation succeeds, then you resolve the effect written on the card. 
After resolving the effect, send the card to the Graveyard. 
These Spell Cards are used to perform Ritual Summons. Use these cards 
in the same way as you would use Normal Spell Cards.
24
Game Cards
Equip Spell Cards
Quick-Play Spell Cards
Field Spell Cards
Continuous Spell Cards
These cards remain on the field once they are activated, and their effect 
continues while the card stays face-up on the field. By using Continuous Spell 
Cards, you can create lasting positive effects with a single card, which is great 
but there is the chance that the opponent will remove it from the field before 
you benefit from the effect.
These are special Spell Cards that can be activated during any Phase of 
your turn, not just your Main Phase. You can also activate them during your 
opponent’s turn if you Set the card face-down first, but then you cannot 
activate the card in the same turn you Set it.
These cards give an extra effect to 
1 face-up monster of your choice 
(either your own or your opponent’s, 
depending on the card). They remain 
on the field after they are activated. 
The Equip Spell Card affects only 
1 monster (called the equipped 
monster), but still occupies one of 
your Spell & Trap Zones. If possible, 
place it in the zone directly behind 
the equipped monster to help you 
remember. If the equipped monster 
is destroyed, flipped face-down, or 
removed from the field, its Equip 
Cards are destroyed.
These cards go in your Field Zone 
and stay there. Each player can have 
1 Field Spell Card on their own side 
of the field. To use another Field 
Spell, send your previous one to the 
Graveyard. Many Field Spell effects 
apply to BOTH players. 
 
These cards may be placed face-
down in the Field Zone, but are not 
active until flipped face-up.

Normal Trap Cards
Before you can activate a Trap Card, you must Set it on the field first. 
You cannot activate a Trap in the same turn that you Set it, but you 
can activate it at any time after that—starting from the beginning of 
the next turn.
Normal Trap Cards have single-use effects and once their effects are 
resolved, they will be sent to the Graveyard, just like Normal Spell 
Cards. They are also similar to Normal Spell Cards because once 
activated, their effects are not likely to be stopped. However, your 
opponent can destroy your face-down Trap Cards on the turn they were 
Set, or before the time is right to activate them. Because of this, you 
must be smart about how you use your Trap Cards.
<<<  Trap Cards
Trap Cards will help you out with 
different effects, just like Spell 
Cards. The big difference between 
them is that you can activate Trap 
Cards during your opponent’s turn. 
Many Spell Cards have effects useful 
for offense, but Trap Cards have 
the ability to surprise the opponent 
by disrupting their attacks and 
strategies. Using Trap Cards can 
sometimes be tricky, since your 
opponent might have to do certain 
things before you can unleash them.
26
Game Cards
n
Continuous Trap Cards
Just like Continuous Spell Cards, Continuous Trap Cards remain on the field 
once they are activated and their effects continue while they are face-up on the 
field. Some Continuous Trap Cards have abilities similar to the Ignition Effects or 
Trigger Effects that can be found on Effect Monster Cards. 
Continuous Trap Cards can have effects that limit your opponent’s options, or 
that slowly damage your opponent’s LP.
Counter Trap Cards
These Trap Cards are normally activated in response to the activation of other 
cards, and may have abilities like negating the effects of those cards. These 
types of Traps are effective against Normal Spell Cards or Normal Trap Cards, 
which are otherwise hard to stop, however many Counter Trap Cards require 
a cost to activate them.
Spell Cards can be Set face-down on the field like Trap Cards. 
However, the rules for the two types of cards are different. 
Spell Cards can be activated during the Main Phases even in the 
same turn that you Set them (except for Quick-Play Spell Cards). 
Setting them does not allow you to use them on your opponent’s 
turn; they still can only be activated during your Main Phase.
You can Set a Spell Card face-down on the field to bluff your 
opponent into thinking you have a powerful Trap.

How To Play
Let the Duel Begin!
Let the Duel Begin!
A single game is called a Duel, and a Duel ends when one player wins 
or the game ends in a draw. Duels are played in sets of 3 called a 
Match, and the winner of best 2-out-of-3 wins the Match.
How to Duel and How to Win
Each player starts a Duel with 8000 LP (Life Points). You win a Duel 
if: you reduce your opponent’s LP to 0; if your opponent is unable 
to draw a card; or if a card’s special effect says you win. If you and 
your opponent both reach 0 LP at the same time, the Duel is declared 
a draw.
Winning a Duel
• Reduce your opponent’s LP to 0.
• Your opponent is unable to draw a card when they are supposed 
  to draw.
• Win with a card’s special effect.

Before starting a Duel, follow these 4 steps. Also, make sure you 
have all your extra items that your Deck might need, like a coin or 
counters.
Preparing to Duel
Preparing to Duel
After greeting your opponent, shuffle your Deck thoroughly. Then you may 
shuffle and cut your opponent’s Deck (be careful when touching your opponent’s 
cards).
After cutting, place the Decks face-down in the proper Deck Zones on the field. 
If using an Extra Deck with Xyz Monsters, Synchro Monsters or Fusion Monsters, 
place it face-down in the Extra Deck Zone.
Both players show each other their Side Decks, and record the number of cards in 
it, also confirming that they have 15 or fewer cards (the cards should be counted 
face-down). If you exchange cards between your Side and Main Decks after a 
Duel, count the cards of your Side Deck for your opponent again to show that the 
number of your cards remain the same.
Play rock-paper-scissors or flip a coin. The winner decides to go first or second 
in the Duel. For your next Duels, the loser of the previous Duel decides who goes 
first. If the previous Duel ended in a tie, determine who starts first in the next 
Duel with another coin toss, etc.
Finally, draw 5 cards from the top of your Deck; this is your starting hand.
Starting with the first player, it is time to Duel!

There is no limit to the number of times you can Flip Summon or 
Special Summon during a turn, but you can only Normal Summon 
or Set a monster (including a Tribute Summon) once per turn. 
Main Phase 1
Possible Actions in this Phase
Summon or Set a Monster
This includes Flip Summoning a monster, or changing the position 
of a face-up monster to face-up Attack or Defense Position. You 
can change the position of each monster you control, except in 
three cases.  1. You cannot change the battle position of a monster 
that was played onto the field this turn.  2. You cannot change it 
in Main Phase 2 if the monster attacked during the Battle Phase. 
3. You cannot change it if you have already changed its battle 
position once this turn.
Change Your Monsters’ Battle Positions
You can activate Spell and Trap Cards, or the effects of Spell, Trap, 
or Effect Monster Cards as many times as you want during this 
phase, as long as you can keep paying any costs involved. 
Active a Card or Effect

Set Spell Cards and Trap Cards
This is when you play most of your cards: you can Normal Summon, 
Set, or change the battle position of a monster, activate a card’s 
effect, and Set Spell and Trap Cards. These actions can be done in 
any order you want, but some actions have restrictions.
32
How To Play
Now it is time to battle with your Monster Cards! This phase is divided

Flow of the

The Battle Phase is split into 
4 steps and is conducted in the 
order shown in the diagram. The 
Battle Step and Damage Step are 
repeated each time you attack 
with a monster.
33
How To Play
This step starts the Battle Phase. The turn player should
announce “I am entering the Battle Phase.” Remember, the player 
who goes first cannot conduct a Battle Phase in their very first 
turn.
Start Step
Select 1 monster on your side of the field to attack with, and 1 of 
your opponent’s monsters as your attack target, and then declare 
the attack. If your opponent does not have any monsters on the 
field, you can attack directly. Play then proceeds to the Damage 
Step. Afterwards, the attacking player returns to the Battle Step, 
and repeats this procedure. Each face-up Attack Position monster 
you control is allowed 1 attack per turn. You do not have to attack 
with a monster if you do not want to.
Battle Step
In this step, the players calculate the result of the battle and 
whatever damage is done. (See “Monster Battle Rules”, page 37.) 
After finishing the Damage Step, return to the Battle Step.
Damage Step
After you have resolved all your battles by repeating the Battle 
and Damage Steps, and you have no more monsters you want to 
attack with, announce to your opponent that you are ending your 
Battle Phase.
End Step
34
How To Play
n
After you have announced your 
attacking monster and the attack 
target monster during a Battle 
Step, the attack target might be 
removed from the field, or a new 
monster may be played onto the 
opponent’s side of the field before 
the Damage Step, due to a card’s 
effect. This causes a “Replay.” 
When this occurs, you can choose 
to attack with the same monster 
again, or choose to attack with a 
different monster, or choose not 
to attack at all. Note that if you 
attack with a different monster, 
the first monster is still considered 
to have declared an attack, and it 
cannot attack again this turn.
Replay Rules during the Battle Step
Declare your attacking 
monster and your attack 
target monster.
A replay happens!
Re-select a target monster.

How To Play
Main Phase 2
If you conducted your Battle Phase, your turn moves to Main Phase 2 
afterwards. The actions a player can perform in this phase are the same 
as in Main Phase 1. However, if the player already did something in Main 
Phase 1 that has a limit to the number of times it can be done, the player 
cannot do it again in Main Phase 2. Consider if you want to activate and 
Set Spell & Trap Cards, or Summon or Set a monster (if you did not do that 
in Main Phase 1) based on your situation after the Battle Phase. Use this 
phase to prepare for the opponent’s turn.
End Phase
Announce the end of your turn, and if there are any cards on the 
field which say “…during the End Phase…” in their text, resolve 
those effects in this phase. If you have more than 6 cards in your 
hand at the end of this phase, select and discard cards to the 
Graveyard until you only have 6 cards in your hand.

DAMAGE STEP RULES
During the Damage Step, you can only activate Counter Trap Cards, 
or cards with effects that directly change a monster’s ATK or DEF. 
Also, these cards can only be activated up until the start of damage 
calculation.
Limitations on Activating Cards
If you attack a face-down Defense Position monster, flip the card to 
face-up Defense Position in the Damage Step. Now you can see the 
monster’s DEF and then calculate damage.
Attacking a Face-Down Card
When an attacked monster is flipped face-up, any Flip effects are 
activated and resolved after damage calculation. If you need to select 
a monster for the Flip effect to target, you cannot target a monster 
that has already been destroyed during damage calculation.
Activation of a Flip Effect
During the Damage Step, there are limits on what cards you can 
activate. Also, during the Damage Step, Flip effects resolve a bit 
differently than they normally do.
37
VS.
Battles and Chains
You calculate battle damage based on the battle position of the 
monster you are attacking. If you attack an Attack Position monster, 
compare ATK vs. ATK. If you attack a Defense Position monster, 
compare your monster’s ATK vs. the attacked monster’s DEF. 
When your attacking monster’s ATK is higher than the ATK of 
the opponent’s monster, the attacking monster destroys the 
opponent’s monster and sends it to the Graveyard. 
The amount that your attacking monster’s ATK exceeds the 
ATK of your opponent’s monster is subtracted from your 
opponent’s LP as battle damage.
When your attacking monster’s ATK is equal to the ATK of the 
opponent’s monster, the result is considered a tie, and both 
monsters are destroyed.
Neither player takes any battle damage.
When your attacking monster’s ATK is lower than the ATK of 
the opponent’s monster, the attacking monster is destroyed 
and sent to the Graveyard.
The amount that the opponent’s monster’s ATK exceeds the

at once (see page 46), or when a player wants to use an effect after 
a card has been played, but BEFORE that card has an effect on the 
game.
If a card’s effect is activated, the opponent is always given a chance 
to respond with a card effect of their own, creating a Chain. If your 
opponent responds with an effect, then you can choose to respond 
and add another effect to the Chain. If your opponent does not 
respond, you may activate a second effect and create a Chain to 
your own card’s activation. Both players continue to add effects to 
the Chain until they both wish to add nothing else, then you resolve 
the outcome in reverse order – starting with the last card that was 
activated.
You must always be careful not to resolve the effects of your cards 
before asking your opponent if they wish to make a Chain.
WHAT IS A CHAIN?
Every type of card effect has a Spell Speed between 1 and 3. If you 
want to respond to a card effect in a Chain, you have to use an effect 
with Spell Speed 2 or higher, and it cannot have a lower Spell Speed 
than the effect you are responding to. Please see page 41 for an 
introduction to each type of card’s Spell Speed. 
SPELL SPEED
40
Battles and Chains
Spell, Trap, and Effect Monster effects have different Spell Speeds. 
There are Spell Speeds from 1 to 3. You can only respond with an 
effect if it is Spell Speed 2 or higher, and has an equal or greater Spell 
Speed than the effect on the Chain Link before it.
n
This is the slowest of all Spell Speeds. These cards cannot be 
activated in response to any other effect. Typically, these effects 
cannot be Chain Link 2 or higher, unless multiple Spell Speed 1 
effects are activated simultaneously.
Spell Speed 1
n
These cards can be used to respond to a Spell Speed 1 or 2 effects, 
and can typically be activated during any phase.
Spell Speed 2
n
This is the fastest of all Spell Speeds and can be used to respond to 
a card of any Spell Speed. Only another Spell Speed 3 card may be 
used to respond to these cards.

As shown in the diagram above, the first effect activated is Chain 
Link 1. The next effect is Chain Link 2, and so on. Every time a new 
Chain Link is made, they are stacked up in the order that the cards 
are activated. Once the Chain is completed, the outcome is resolved 
starting with the most recent card to be activated at the top of the 
Chain and proceeding down to Chain Link 1.

Player A plays “Heavy Storm” and Player B responds by activating 
their Set “Threatening Roar.” Then, Player A responds to that by 
activating “Seven Tools of the Bandit.”
In this case, Chain Links are stacked up as seen below.

“Seven Tools of the Bandit”
Negates the effect of “Threatening Roar”

“Threatening Roar” 
Prevents the opponent from declaring attacks this turn.

“Heavy Storm” 
Destroys all Spell and Trap Cards on the field.
Spell Speed 1 
”Seven Tools of the Bandit” (Chain Link 3) is resolved first and 
negates the activation of “Threatening Roar.” 
“Threatening Roar” (Chain Link 2) would then be resolved, but the 
effect of “Seven Tools of the Bandit” stops its activation. The turn 
player will still be able to declare attacks.
Then the effect of “Heavy Storm” (Chain Link 1) is resolved 
successfully, destroying all Spell and Trap Cards on the field, 
allowing the turn player to attack without interference from Spell 
or Trap Cards.

Battles and Chains
The turn player always starts with Priority, or the choice to 
activate a card first, in each phase or step of their turn. As long as 
the turn player has Priority, the opponent cannot activate cards 
or effects, except for effects that activate automatically, like 
Trigger or Flip effects. 
The turn player can either:
TURN PLAYER’S PRIORITY
A player must pass Priority to the opponent when moving on to 
the next phase or step. Strictly speaking, you would always declare 
that you are passing Priority before the end of every phase and 
step, and ask your opponent if they wish to play a card. However, 
for ease of play, announcing the end of your phases or steps 
implies giving up Priority. Therefore, when announcing the end of 
a phase, your opponent can just say “Before the end of your phase, 
I activate this card” and use a card. 
• Use Priority to play a card or activate an effect OR
• Pass Priority to the opponent so they can activate an effect. 
• The turn player starts with Priority to activate a card or effect 
  first.
• After a card’s activation, and at the end of each phase or step, 
  Priority passes to the opponent.

Other Rules
n
Normally, your Deck (including Extra Deck and Side Deck) can 
contain up to 3 copies of a card that has the same name. However, 
certain cards have specific quantity restrictions that further limit the 
number that can be included in a Deck.
There are 3 types of restrictions: Limited cards are restricted to 
1 copy in a Deck, while Semi-Limited cards are restricted to 2 copies 
in a Deck. Forbidden cards are not allowed to be included at all. 
The list of Forbidden and Limited cards is updated regularly and is 
posted on the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG Official Website.
This list is applied to official tournaments so please check it before 
participating.

Forbidden & Limited Cards
n
Monster Tokens are monsters that appear on the field as the result 
of a card’s effect. They are not included in the Deck, and cannot be 
sent anywhere other than the field, such as the hand or Graveyard. 
When a Token is destroyed or returned to the hand or Deck, they are 
simply removed from the field instead.
You can use official Token cards or use coins, 
card sleeves, or any similar marker (as long 
as it can indicate Attack Position or Defense 
Position) as Monster Tokens and play them in 
Monster Zones. Each Monster Token takes up  
1 of your 5 Monster Zones. Their battle position is 
always either face-up Attack Position or face-up 
Defense Position. Tokens cannot be used as an 
Xyz Material.

The number of cards in a player’s hand and Decks, the cards in their 
Graveyards, and each player’s current LP are all public knowledge 
and both players can verify these things at any time. If asked, you 
must answer these things to your opponent truthfully. You are 
allowed to pick up and verify the cards in your opponent’s Graveyard 
but you must ask their permission first. Also, you may not change the 
order of the cards when verifying their Graveyard.
Public Knowledge
n
For cases like “Each player targets 1 monster,” where both players 
resolve an effect simultaneously, the turn player resolves the effect 
first. In this example, after the turn player makes their selection, the 
other player makes theirs.
If both players conduct actions simultaneously
n
If effects of Spell Speed 1 cards (like Trigger Effects) are activated at the 
same time, they will be resolved in a special Chain.
This Chain is made starting with the turn player’s effects. If there is 
only 1 effect, that will be Chain Link 1. If there are 2 or more effects, the 
turn player builds the Chain with their card effects, selecting the order 
in which they go on the Chain. Then the opponent continues the Chain 
with their effects. Therefore, the effects will be resolved starting with 
those of the opponent.
When multiple cards are activated simultaneously
n
Monsters with 0 ATK cannot destroy anything by battle. If two Attack 
Position monsters with 0 ATK battle each other, neither monster is 
destroyed. 
0 ATK monsters 
n
If there is a discrepancy between the basic rules and a card’s effect, the 
card effect takes precedence. For example, a monster can only attack 
once per turn, but with a card effect, it is possible to attack twice.

You may need to place these on cards for some card effects. You 
cannot place counters unless a card effect allows it. Cards may have 
effects that change with the number of counters on them, or require 
you to remove counters as a cost. Some counters have specific 
names, such as “Spell Counter” or “Clock Counter.” Other than their 
names, each individual counter itself does not have any effects.  
Counters
n
You can only create a Chain by responding to the activation of a card 
or effect. Summoning a monster, Tributing, changing a monster’s 
battle position and paying costs are not effect activations and 
therefore you cannot respond to those actions using a Chain.
Actions which cannot be Chained to
n
Monsters that are used to Xyz Summon are called “Xyz Materials”, 
and are placed underneath the Xyz Monster, to show that they are 
attached to it. Monsters that have become Xyz Materials are not 
treated as cards on the field. When an Xyz Monster leaves the field, 
all of the Xyz Materials attached to it are sent to the Graveyard. If 
an Xyz Monster is flipped face-down, or becomes controlled by the 
opponent, the Xyz Materials are not sent to the Graveyard. They 
remain attached to the Xyz Monster.
Xyz Materials
n
Some monsters have effects that activate when they “leave the field”. 
For example, these effects activate when the monster is sent to 
the Graveyard, or is banished, or is returned to the hand or Extra 
Deck. When a monster on the field is shuffled into the Main Deck, or 
becomes an Xyz Material, it is no longer a card on the field, however 
its effects that activate when it “leaves the field” will not activate.

Other Rules
Attacking directly means that a monster attacks a player instead 
of attacking a monster. In this case, the damage to the player will 
be equal to the monster’s ATK. Some monsters have an effect that 
allows them to attack directly even if the opponent controls a 
monster.
l Attack Directly
Although a card that has been used is normally sent to the 
Graveyard, a card which is banished is separated from the field 
instead. You must return your banished cards so you can use them 
for the next Duel.
l Banished Cards (Previously Remove from Play)
Battle damage is damage inflicted to a player by an attacking 
monster, or by a battle between two monsters. This is different 
from damage from the effect of an Effect Monster, Spell Card or 
Trap Card.
l Battle Damage
When “cards on the field” is written in card text, it means all the 
cards on the Game Mat other than the Graveyard, Deck, and Extra 
Deck.
l Cards on the Field
A card you control is a card on your side of the field. You are 
the player that gets to make decisions regarding that card. Your 
opponent can take control of a card away from you with a card 
effect. In that case the card is moved to your opponent’s side of the 
field. However, if your card that is controlled by your opponent is 
sent to the Graveyard, or returned to the hand or Deck, it is always 
returned to the hand or Deck of the card’s owner.
l Control
48
Other Rules
A card is destroyed when it is sent to the Graveyard due to battle 
between monsters or by an effect that destroys a card. A card that 
is returned from the field to the hand or Deck, or, that is sent to 
the Graveyard as a cost or Tribute, is NOT considered “destroyed.” 
l Destroy
Discard means to send a card from your hand to the Graveyard. 
This can happen because of a card effect or by adjusting the 
number of cards in your hand during the End Phase.
l Discard
The effect of a card is the special ability written on it, like the effect 
of a Spell, Trap, or Effect Monster. Costs that are needed to activate 
an ability are not part of the effect. The conditions that describe 
how to play a “Special Summon Monster” are also not an effect. 
l Effects of Cards
In addition to Equip Spell Cards, sometimes Trap Cards or Monster 
Cards can become equipped to a monster. Equipped Traps remain Trap 
Cards, but equipped monsters are considered to be Equip Spells. The 
term “Equip Card” includes all 3 kinds (standard Equip Spells, equipped 
Traps, and monsters equipped to other monsters). If a Monster Card is 
equipped to another monster, it remains equipped to that monster and 
cannot be moved to a different target, even by card effects that would 
normally be able to do so.
EXCEPTION: Union monsters equipped by their own effects can be 
moved by appropriate card effects.
l Equip Cards
A monster that is equipped with an Equip Card is an “equipped 
monster.” When this monster is destroyed or flipped face-down, 
the equipped card loses its target, and is destroyed and sent to 
the Graveyard.
l Equipped Monster
49
The Original ATK (or DEF) is the number of ATK (or DEF) points printed on 
the Monster Card. This does not include an increase from an Equip Spell 
Card or other card effect. 
l Original ATK (or DEF)
To pay a cost is an action required by a player in order to activate a card, 
an effect, or to Summon a monster. Tributing to Tribute Summon a Level 
5 monster is an example of a cost. Other common costs are discarding, 
paying LP, or banishing cards. You have to pay any costs before you 
declare the activation of the card. Even if the activation of the card is 
negated, you cannot get a refund of the cost that you have paid.
l Pay a Cost
Some monsters can inflict piercing battle damage when they attack a 
Defense Position monster. This means that you inflict damage to your 
opponent’s LP equal to the difference between the attacking monster’s 
ATK and the defending monster’s DEF.
l Piercing Battle Damage
When a card effect says to choose a card randomly, there is no official 
way of doing so, it is fine as long as neither player has a way of knowing 
which card is being chosen.
l Random
When an effect says to reveal a card, you show it to both players. You 
may have to reveal a face-down card, a card from your hand, or from the 
top of your Deck. Revealing a card does not activate the card or its Flip 
effect. Normally, revealed cards are returned to their original position 
after being looked at by both players.
l Reveal
When a card says to “excavate” cards from your Deck, you reveal those 
cards to both players. Then, before you do anything else, apply the 
instructions from the card effect that excavated them. Cards that are 
being excavated are still treated as being in the Deck until sent elsewhere 
by the card instructions.
l Excavate
Other Rules
50
Other Rules
A card can be sent to the Graveyard in various ways. Destroying a card, 
discarding, and Tributing a monster are all actions that send a card to 
the Graveyard, and will normally activate “When this card is sent to the 
Graveyard…” Trigger Effects. 
EXCEPTION: When a banished card is moved to the Graveyard, it is not 
considered to be “sent to the Graveyard”.
l Send to the Graveyard
Playing a card face-down is called a Set. For Monster Cards, playing it in 
face-down Defense Position is called a Set. Any card that is face-down 
on the field is a Set card.
l Set
There is no rule for how to shuffle, but while shuffling you cannot look at 
the cards you are shuffling, or arrange the cards and then shuffle them.
l Shuff le
Tributing is sending a monster you control to the Graveyard. You can 
Tribute a face-up or face-down monster, unless otherwise specified. 
Tributing a monster is one possible cost for Summoning a monster or 
activating an effect. A monster sent to the Graveyard by Tributing is not 
treated as “destroyed.”
l Tribute
Whenever an effect instructs you to add a card from your Deck to your 
hand, or to Special Summon a monster from your Deck, you can pick 
up your Deck and search through it for the appropriate card. You must 
shuffle your Deck after any time you search it and let your opponent 
shuffle or cut. You cannot activate an effect to search your Deck for a 
card if there are no cards that meet the requirements in your Deck.
l Search your Deck
